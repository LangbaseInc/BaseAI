# FAQs

Let's take a look at some frequently asked questions about tools.

---

## What is tool calling?

LLM tool calling allows a language model (like GPT) to use external tools (functions inside your codebase) to **perform** tasks it can't handle alone.

Instead of just generating text, the model can **respond with a tool call** (name of the function to call with parameters) that triggers a function in your code.

You can use tool calling to get the model to do things like fetch live information, run code for complex calculations, get some data from a database, or interact with other systems.

### Key benefits:

- **Enhanced capabilities**: Lets the model go beyond text generation, enabling it to do more practical tasks.
- **Better accuracy**: For tasks like precise calculations or up-to-date data, it ensures correct, reliable results.
- **Wider applications**: Makes the model more useful in real-world situations, allowing it to interact with other systems seamlessly.

## How to create a tool using BaseAI?

You can create a `tool` command by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx baseai@latest tool
```

You can learn more about it [here](/docs/tool/quickstart).

---

## What models in BaseAI support tool calling?

Currently all the OpenAI models like GPT-3, GPT-4, etc., support tool calling in BaseAI.

---

## How to use tool calling in BaseAI?

We have a detailed guide on how to use tool calling in BaseAI. You can learn more [here](/docs/tools/quickstart).

---

## Can I use tool calling in my private AI agent pipe?

Yes, you can use tool calling in any AI agent pipe configured with OpenAI models.

---

## Can I call other pipes from a tool?

Yes, you can call other pipes from a tool. Since tool is a function in your code, you can call any pipe from it.

---

## Are my tools deployed on Langbase when I deploy a Pipe?

Yes, all your Pipe tools are deployed when you deploy a Pipe. Please note that only the tool definition is deployed, not the actual code. So you will need to ensure that the code is available in your codebase.

You can learn more about deploying a Pipe [here](/docs/deployment/deploy).
