# Quickstart: Build a weather tool

### Let's build your first tool in a minute.

---

In this quickstart guide, you will locally:

-  **Create** a weather tool that returns the current weather for a given location.
-  **Create** a local AI agent pipe that uses the tool to generate weather information.
-  **Integrate** the tool in the agent pipe.
-  **Run** the AI pipe with configuration and meta settings.
-  **Build** your pipe with integrated tools.
-  **Deploy** your AI features to Langbase API (global, highly available, and scalable) for production.

---

### Let's get started

Let's build a tool locally using BaseAI that will return the current weather for a given location.

---

## Step #1: Create a weather tool

We need to create a tool now. To do it, inside your project, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npx baseai@latest tool
```

The CLI will ask you to provide the name and description of the tool. Let's call it `getCurrentWeather` and provide a description like `Get the current weather for a given location`.

Your tool will be created at `/baseai/tools/get-current-weather.ts`.

## Step #2: View and configure the tool

Now that we have created a current weather tool, let's open the file and see what we have in there.

<CodeGroup exampleTitle="Current weather tool" title="getCurrentWeather tool">

```ts {{ title: './baseai/tools/get-current-weather.ts' }}
import { ToolI } from '@baseai/core';

export async function getCurrentWeather() {
	// Your tool logic here
}

const getCurrentWeatherTool = (): ToolI => ({
	run: getCurrentWeather,
	type: 'function' as const,
	function: {
		name: 'getCurrentWeather',
		description: 'Get the current weather for a given location',
		parameters: {},
	},
});

export default getCurrentWeatherTool;
```

</CodeGroup>

The `run` key in the `getCurrentWeatherTool` object is the function that will be executed when the tool is called. You can write your logic to get the current weather for a given location in the `getCurrentWeather` function. Let's add a static return for now.

Here's what the updated `get-current-weather.ts` file will look like:

<CodeGroup exampleTitle="Current weather tool" title="Configure the weather tool">

```ts {{ title: './baseai/tools/get-current-weather.ts' }}
import {ToolI} from '@baseai/core';

export async function getCurrentWeather(location: string, unit: string) {
	return `Weather in ${location} is 72 degrees ${unit === 'celsius' ? 'Celsius' : 'Fahrenheit'}`;
}

const getCurrentWeatherTool = (): ToolI => ({
	run: getCurrentWeather,
	type: 'function' as const,
	function: {
		name: 'getCurrentWeather',
		description: 'Get the current weather for a given location',
		parameters: {
			type: 'object',
			properties: {
				location: {
					type: 'string',
					description: 'The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA',
				},
				unit: {
					type: 'string',
					enum: ['celsius', 'fahrenheit'],
				},
			},
			required: ['location'],
		},
	},
});

export default getCurrentWeatherTool;
```

</CodeGroup>

You can see that I have also added parameters to the `getCurrentWeather` function. The LLM will give values to these parameters when it calls the tool.

## Step #3: Create an AI agent Pipe

Navigate to your project directory, and create a new pipe using the `baseai pipe` command. It will ask you for the name, description, and other details of the pipe step-by-step.

Since we already created a tool in preview step, `baseai pipe` will ask you to select the tool you want to use in the pipe. Select the `get-current-weather` tool in this case.

```bash
npx baseai@latest pipe
```

## Step #4: View and configure your pipe

Your pipe is created successfully at `/baseai/pipes/weather-agent.ts`. Open the file, it will look like this:

<CodeGroup exampleTitle="BaseAI Pipe & Tool" title="Weather agent pipe">

```ts {{ title: './baseai/pipes/weather-agent.ts' }}
import {PipeI} from '@baseai/core';
import getCurrentWeatherTool from '../tools/get-current-weather';

const pipeName = (): PipeI => ({
	apiKey: process.env.LANGBASE_API_KEY!, // Replace with your API key https://langbase.com/docs/api-reference/api-keys
	name: 'weather-agent',
	description: '',
	status: 'private',
	model: 'openai:gpt-4o-mini',
	stream: false,
	json: false,
	store: true,
	moderate: true,
	top_p: 1,
	max_tokens: 1000,
	temperature: 0.7,
	presence_penalty: 1,
	frequency_penalty: 1,
	stop: [],
	tool_choice: 'auto',
	parallel_tool_calls: false,
	messages: [
		{role: 'system', content: `You are a helpful AI assistant.`},
		{
			role: 'system',
			name: 'rag',
			content:
				"Below is some CONTEXT for you to answer the questions. ONLY answer from the CONTEXT. CONTEXT consists of multiple information chunks. Each chunk has a source mentioned at the end.\n\nFor each piece of response you provide, cite the source in brackets like so: [1].\n\nAt the end of the answer, always list each source with its corresponding number and provide the document name. like so [1] Filename.doc.\n\nIf you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know. Ask for more context and better questions if needed.",
		},
	],
	variables: [],
	memory: [],
	tools: [getCurrentWeatherTool()],
});

export default pipeName;
```

```ts {{ title: './baseai/tools/get-current-weather.ts' }}
import {ToolI} from '@baseai/core';

export async function getCurrentWeather(location: string, unit: string) {
	return `Weather in ${location} is 72 degrees ${unit === 'celsius' ? 'Celsius' : 'Fahrenheit'}`;
}

const getCurrentWeatherTool = (): ToolI => ({
	run: getCurrentWeather,
	type: 'function' as const,
	function: {
		name: 'getCurrentWeather',
		description: 'Get the current weather for a given location',
		parameters: {
			type: 'object',
			properties: {
				location: {
					type: 'string',
					description: 'The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA',
				},
				unit: {
					type: 'string',
					enum: ['celsius', 'fahrenheit'],
				},
			},
			required: ['location'],
		},
	},
});

export default getCurrentWeatherTool;
```
</CodeGroup>

As you can see in the `pipeName` function, we have added the `getCurrentWeatherTool` to the `tools` array. This will allow the pipe to use the tool to get the current weather for a given location. I have also turn off the stream.

## Step #5: Integrate the pipe with your app

Create a `index.ts` file in your project and import the pipe you created in the previous step. We will use the Pipe primitive from `@baseai/core` to run the pipe.

```bash
# Create a new file index.ts
touch index.ts

# Install the required packages
npm install @baseai/core dotenv
```

Add the following code to `index.ts` file:

<CodeGroup exampleTitle="BaseAI Pipe & Tool" title="Run AI agent Pipe with tools">

```ts {{ title: 'index.ts' }}
import 'dotenv/config';
import {Pipe, generateText} from '@baseai/core';
import pipeSummarizer from './baseai/pipes/summarizer';

const pipe = new Pipe(pipeSummarizer());

const userMsg = `What's the weather in San Francisco?`;

async function main() {
	const response = await generateText({
		pipe,
		messages: [{role: 'user', content: userMsg}],
	});

	console.log(response.completion);
}

main();
```

```ts {{ title: './baseai/pipes/weather-agent.ts' }}
import {PipeI} from '@baseai/core';
import getCurrentWeatherTool from '../tools/get-current-weather';

const pipeName = (): PipeI => ({
	apiKey: process.env.LANGBASE_API_KEY!, // Replace with your API key https://langbase.com/docs/api-reference/api-keys
	name: 'weather-agent',
	description: '',
	status: 'private',
	model: 'openai:gpt-4o-mini',
	stream: false,
	json: false,
	store: true,
	moderate: true,
	top_p: 1,
	max_tokens: 1000,
	temperature: 0.7,
	presence_penalty: 1,
	frequency_penalty: 1,
	stop: [],
	tool_choice: 'auto',
	parallel_tool_calls: false,
	messages: [
		{role: 'system', content: `You are a helpful AI assistant.`},
		{
			role: 'system',
			name: 'rag',
			content:
				"Below is some CONTEXT for you to answer the questions. ONLY answer from the CONTEXT. CONTEXT consists of multiple information chunks. Each chunk has a source mentioned at the end.\n\nFor each piece of response you provide, cite the source in brackets like so: [1].\n\nAt the end of the answer, always list each source with its corresponding number and provide the document name. like so [1] Filename.doc.\n\nIf you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know. Ask for more context and better questions if needed.",
		},
	],
	variables: [],
	memory: [],
	tools: [getCurrentWeatherTool()],
});

export default pipeName;
```

```ts {{ title: './baseai/tools/get-current-weather.ts' }}
import {ToolI} from '@baseai/core';

export async function getCurrentWeather(location: string, unit: string) {
	return `Weather in ${location} is 72 degrees ${unit === 'celsius' ? 'Celsius' : 'Fahrenheit'}`;
}

const getCurrentWeatherTool = (): ToolI => ({
	run: getCurrentWeather,
	type: 'function' as const,
	function: {
		name: 'getCurrentWeather',
		description: 'Get the current weather for a given location',
		parameters: {
			type: 'object',
			properties: {
				location: {
					type: 'string',
					description: 'The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA',
				},
				unit: {
					type: 'string',
					enum: ['celsius', 'fahrenheit'],
				},
			},
			required: ['location'],
		},
	},
});

export default getCurrentWeatherTool;
```
</CodeGroup>

We have added a demo user message and asked for the weather in San Francisco. You can change this user message as per your requirements.

```txt
What's the weather in San Francisco?
```

Since we are using an OpenAI model, your OpenAI key is required. Please create an `.env` file in the root directory using the following command:

```bash
touch .env
```

Once you have created the `.env` file, add your OpenAI key to it.

```txt
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-open-ai-key" # Add your OpenAI API key in .env file
```

## Step #4 Start baseai server

To run the pipe locally, you need to start the BaseAI server. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx baseai@latest dev
```

## Step #5: Run the code

Run the `index.ts` file using the following command:

```bash
npx tsx index.ts
```

It will prompt the LLM model to get answers to your weather query.

```txt
The current weather in San Francisco is 72 degrees Fahrenheit.
```

Earlier in step no. 2, we added 72 degrees Fahrenheit as a static return. You can see this value was sent to the LLM and it used it to generate the response.

This all happens locally on your machine and the response should be streamed in your terminal.

## Next Steps

Now that you have successfully created a tool and used it in a Pipe, you can deploy this pipe seamlessly on Langbase using the [deploy](/docs/deployment/deploy) command.
