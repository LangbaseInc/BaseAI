# Create a Memory

Create a memory locally using BaseAI CLI.

---

## Step #1 Create memory

Create a new memory using the `memory` command. It will ask you for name and description of the memory.

Let's use the name `chat-with-docs` for this example.

```bash
npx baseai@latest memory
```

It creates a memory at `baseai/memory/chat-with-docs` in your current directory. Add documents to `baseai/memory/chat-with-docs/documents` for use.

## Step #2 Add documents

Add documents to the memory by placing them in the `documents` directory of the memory.

---

## Next Steps

Use the [`embed` command to generate embeddings](/docs/memory/embed) for the documents in the memory.
