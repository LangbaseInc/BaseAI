# Embed a Memory Document

If you add a new document to the memory or change the document, you need to embed the document to use it with the memory.


<Note>
Please make sure to add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to `.env` file in the root of your project. This is required to generate embeddings for the documents in the memory.
</Note>

## Embed a document

Pass the memory name and document name to the `embed` command using the `--memory` flag or `-m` for short and `--document` flag or `-d` for short.

```bash
baseai embed -m chat-with-docs -d document-name
```

It will generate embeddings and update the memory index. If the document is already embedded, it will update the embeddings for the document.
