# Retrieve Memory

Retrieve similar chunks of information from memory using BaseAI CLI.

<Note>
Please make sure to add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to `.env` file in the root of your project. This is required to generate embeddings for the documents in the memory.
</Note>

---

## Step #0 Prerequisites

Make sure you have a memory [created and embedded](/docs/memory/create).

---

## Step #1 Retrieve information

Retrieve similar chunks of information from memory using the `retrieve` command. You need to provide the memory name and the query to retrieve the information.

**Upto 20 similar chunks** of information are retrieved from the memory for the query. The output contains the information, similarity score, and the source of the information.

The output is from memory created in [quickstart guide](/docs/memory/quickstart).


```bash
baseai retrieve -m chat-with-docs -q "Default LLM"
```
