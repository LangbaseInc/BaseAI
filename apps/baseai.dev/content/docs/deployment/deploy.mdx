# Deploy

Use the `deploy` command to deploy a project using the BaseAI CLI to Langbase. Before you deploy a project, make sure you are [authenticated](/docs/deployment/authentication) with the BaseAI CLI.

```bash
npx baseai@latest deploy
```

It will deploy all AI agent Pipes and Memory in the current project directory to Langbase.

---

## Deployment Workflow

During deployment, the BaseAI CLI adjusts its behavior based on the current status of Pipes and Memory in Langbase.

### Pipe Deployment

The pipe deployment process covers the following cases:

- If a **Pipe does not exist** in Langbase, it will create a new Pipe.
- If a **Pipe already exists** in Langbase, it will overwrite the Pipe with the local Pipe.
- If you are using an **ollama** model, it will be deployed with `gpt-4o-mini`.


### Memory Deployment

Memory deployment handles the following scenarios:

-   If the **memory does not exist** on Langbase, it will be created.
-   If the **memory already exists**, it will proceed as follows:
    -   If the **documents on Langbase match the local memory**, the memory deployment will be skipped.
	-	If the **Langbase memory is a subset of the local memory**, only new documents will be uploaded.
	-	If the **Langbase memory contains more documents than the local memory**, the user will be prompted to confirm an overwrite:
	    -	If confirmed, the local memory will **overwrite** the existing memory on Langbase.
	    -	If not confirmed, the memory deployment will be **skipped**.

**Note** that in the case: "*If the documents on Langbase match the local memory, the memory deployment will be skipped.*", the check is a shallow comparison based on the document names. If you want to overwrite the memory, you can use the `overwrite` flag.

## Overwrite

If you want to overwrite the existing pipes and memory on Langbase, you can use the `overwrite` flag.

```bash
baseai deploy --overwrite # or -o
```

## Deploy BaseAI Applications


When you deploy a project to prod that uses BaseAI, ensure that `LANGBASE_API_KEY` is set in the production environment. This key is required to authenticate with Langbase and access deployed AI agents and memory.

Use appropriate [Org or User API key](https://langbase.com/docs/api-reference/api-keys) to authenticate with Langbase.
