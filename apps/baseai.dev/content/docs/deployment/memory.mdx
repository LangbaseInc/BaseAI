# Deploy Memory to Langbase

Deploy a memory on [Langbase](https://langbase.com/) using the BaseAI CLI. Before you deploy a memory, make sure you are [authenticated](/docs/deployment/authentication) with the BaseAI CLI.

---

## Deploy a memory

Pass the memory name to the `deploy` command using the `--memory` flag or `-m` for short.

```bash
npx baseai@latest deploy -m <memory-name>
```

Single memory deploy follows the [deploy Workflow](/docs/deployment/deploy#deployment-workflow).

---

## Overwrite an existing memory

Overwrite an existing memory on Langbase using the `--overwrite` flag or `-o` for short.

```bash
npx baseai@latest deploy -m <memory-name> -o
```

For the git synced memory, `-o` is neglected and the new changes are pushed to the Langbase memory.
