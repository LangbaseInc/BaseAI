# BaseAI Configuration file

Here's an overview of the BaseAI project structure in your application.

---

## Overview

The `baseai` folder is present at the root of your application/project. This folder contains the BaseAI configuration file named as
`baseai.config.ts`.

```shell
# Your project's root directory
- baseai
  - baseai.config.ts
```

This file contains all the default configurations of BaseAI that are used by the CLI during the development of your application. You can modify these configurations as per your requirements.

```ts {{title: "baseai.config.ts"}}
import type {BaseAIConfig} from 'baseai';

export const config: BaseAIConfig = {
  "log": {
    "isEnabled": true,
    "logSensitiveData": false,
    "pipe": true,
    "pipe.completion": true,
    "pipe.request": true,
    "pipe.response": true,
    "tool": false,
    "memory": false
  },
  "memory": {
    "useLocalEmbeddings": false
  },
  "envFilePath": ".env"
};
```

Here is a breakdown of the configurations present in the `baseai.config.ts` file.

### `log`

The `log` object contains the configurations for logging in the application. You can enable or disable logging for different parts of the application like pipes, tools, and memory.

---

### `memory`

The `memory` object contains the configurations for memory in the application. You can enable or disable the use of local embeddings for memory.

```ts
"memory": {
  "useLocalEmbeddings": false
}
```

Please check out the [memory quickstart](/docs/memory/quickstart) to get started.

---

### `envFilePath`

The `envFilePath` key contains the path to the `.env` file in your application. You can change the path as per your requirements. It is set to the root of the application by default.

```ts
"envFilePath": ".env"
```
