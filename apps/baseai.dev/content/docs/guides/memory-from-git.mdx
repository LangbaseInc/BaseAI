# Create a Memory from git Repository

Create a memory from a git repository using BaseAI CLI.

---

## Step #1 Create memory in your existing git repository

Create a new memory using the `memory` command in root of project. It will ask you for name and description of the memory.

Let's use the name `chat-with-repo` for this example.

```bash
npx baseai@latest memory
```

## Step #2 Allow memory to track git repository

It will also prompt you if you want to create a memory from the current project git repository. Select `yes`.
```
Do you want to create memory from current project git repository? (yes/no) yes
```

## Step #3 Provide directory 

Next, it will ask you which directory or subdirectory you want to use for the memory. You can select the current directory or any subdirectory.

```
Enter the path to the directory to track (relative to current directory): 
```

Provide the path relative to the root of the project directory that you want to use for the memory. E.g., `src/content/docs`, to use the `docs` directory in the `src/content` directory.

## Step #4 Provide file extensions

Next, it will ask you which files extensions you want to track. You can provide a comma-separated list of file extensions. E.g., `.mdx,.md` to track markdown files. Alternatively, you can provide `*` to track all files.

```
Enter file extensions to track (use * for all, or comma-separated list, e.g., .md,.mdx)
```

That's it! It creates a memory at `baseai/memory/chat-with-repo` in your current directory that tracks the git repository directory and file extensions you provided.

## Step #5 Deploy the memory

Commit all the changes to git and deploy. 

```bash
npx baseai@latest deploy -m chat-with-repo
```

Next time you want to update the memory with the latest changes from the git repository, you can run the `deploy` command again. Make sure to commit all the changes before deploying.

## Running the memory locally

You can embed the memory locally using the `embed` command. Just like any other memory and use it with a Pipe. Follow the [quickstart guide](/docs/memory/quickstart) to see how to embed and use the memory.
