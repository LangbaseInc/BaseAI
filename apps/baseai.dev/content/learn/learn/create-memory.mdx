# Create a memory for pipe

### Learn how to create a memory for a pipe using BaseAI

<Note sub="/learn">
This guide is part of the /learn BaseAI course. For context, [start from the beginning](/learn) to follow along.
</Note>

In this learn guide, you will create a **memory** for a pipe.

---

## Run `memory`

Let's create a memory for our Pipe. To do it, inside your project, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npx baseai@latest memory
```

The CLI will ask you to provide the name and description of the memory. Let's call it `chat-with-docs` and provide a description like `A memory containing Langbase Pipe FAQs docs`.

Your memory will be created at `baseai/memory/chat-with-docs`.

_In the next learn guide, we will add documents to the memory we just created._
