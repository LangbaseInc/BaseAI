<Note sub="/learn">
This guide is part of the /learn BaseAI course. For context, [start from the beginning](/learn) to follow along.

In these learn guides, you will learn how to locally:

-  **Create** a summarization agent AI pipe.
-  **Run** the AI pipe with configuration and meta settings.
-  **Create** a weather tool that returns the current weather for a given location.
-  **Integrate** the tool in the agent pipe.
-  **Run** the AI pipe with the integrated tool.
-  **Create** a memory and add documents to it.
-  **Embed** the memory to generate embeddings for the documents.
-  **Integrate** the memory with the agent pipe.
-  **Run** the AI pipe with the integrated memory.

## Initialize npm

Create a directory in your local machine and navigate to it. Run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npm init -y
```

This command will create a `package.json` file in your project directory with default values.

_In the next learn guide, we will use BaseAI to create a summarizer agentic AI pipe._
