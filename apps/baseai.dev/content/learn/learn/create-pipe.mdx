# Create an AI pipe

### Learn how to create an agentic AI pipe using BaseAI

Pipe is a serverless AI agent. Read more about [Pipe](/docs/pipe/quickstart).

<Note sub="/learn">
This guide is part of the /learn BaseAI course. For context, [start from the beginning](/learn) to follow along.

In this learn guide, you will create a **summarization** agentic AI pipe.

---

## Run `pipe`

Navigate to your project directory. Run the following command:

```bash
npx baseai@latest pipe
```

It will ask you for the name, description, and other details of the pipe step-by-step.

Once you are done, your pipe will be created successfully at `/baseai/pipes/summarizer.ts`.

---

_In the next learn guide, we will configure the summarizer pipe we created._
