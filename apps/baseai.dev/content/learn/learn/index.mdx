# Build an agentic AI pipe with tools

### Learn how to build an agentic AI pipe with tools and memory


<Note sub="/learn">
Welcome to the `/learn` BaseAI course. We use Node.js as an example but there are several other production-ready example in our open-source repo including Next.js, Remix, and more. Check out the [examples](https://github.com/LangbaseInc/baseai/tree/main/examples) to see how to use BaseAI in your project.

In these learn guides, you will learn how to locally:

-  **Create** a summarization agent AI pipe.
-  **Run** the AI pipe with configuration and meta settings.
-  **Create** a weather tool that returns the current weather for a given location.
-  **Integrate** the tool in the agent pipe.
-  **Run** the AI pipe with the integrated tool.
-  **Create** a memory and add documents to it.
-  **Embed** the memory to generate embeddings for the documents.
-  **Integrate** the memory with the agent pipe.
-  **Run** the AI pipe with the integrated memory.

## Initialize npm

Create a directory in your local machine and navigate to it. Run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
mkdir my-ai-project
npm init -y
npm install dotenv
```

This command will create a `package.json` file in your project directory with default values. It will also install `dotenv` package to read environment variables from `.env` file.

_In the next learn guide, we will use BaseAI to create a summarizer agentic AI pipe._
