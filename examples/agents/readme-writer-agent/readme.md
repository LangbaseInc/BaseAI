 ![IT Systems Triage Agent by ⌘ BaseAI][cover]

 ![License: MIT][mit] [![Fork on ⌘ Langbase][fork]][pipe]

## Description
The `readme-writer-agent` is an AI-powered tool designed to assist developers in creating comprehensive README files for their open-source projects. This tool simplifies the process of structuring and writing documentation, ensuring that important information is communicated effectively.

This AI Agent is built using the BaseAI framework. It leverages an agentic pipe that integrates over 30+ LLMs (including OpenAI, Gemini, Mistral, Llama, Gemma, etc.) and can handle any data, with context sizes of up to 10M+ tokens, supported by memory. The framework is compatible with any front-end framework (such as React, Remix, Astro, Next.js), giving you, as a developer, the freedom to tailor your AI application exactly as you envision.

## How to use

Navigate to `examples/agents/readme-writer-agent` and run the following commands:

```sh
# Navigate to baseai/examples/agents/readme-writer-agent
cd examples/agents/readme-writer-agent

# Install the dependencies
npm install

# Run the agent
npm run write-readme
```
