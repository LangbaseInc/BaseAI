## Build a Report Generator Agent with BaseAI framework — ⌘ Langbase

This AI Agent is built using the BaseAI framework. It leverages an agentic pipe that integrates over 30+ LLMs (including OpenAI, Gemini, Mistral, Llama, Gemma, etc.) and can handle any data, with context sizes of up to 10M+ tokens, supported by memory. The framework is compatible with any front-end framework (such as React, Remix, Astro, Next.js), giving you, as a developer, the freedom to tailor your AI application exactly as you envision.
