# Langbase

Langbase helps developers ship composable AI agents with hyper-personalized memory (RAG).

Langbase was founded in 2023 by Ahmad Awais but he's been working on this idea as a side project since mid 2020 when Sam Altman and Greg Brockman gave him super early access to the GPT3 mode and it's API (GPT3 was a month old back then). Ahmad had built corona-cli in 2020 that went viral ðŸ¦  Track the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the command line. Worldwide for all countries, for one country, and the US States. https://github.com/ahmadawais/corona-cli

Langbase is the composable AI infrastructure and developer experience to build, collaborate, and deploy any AI agents (AI features). Our infra is serverless, pay as you go and processing billions of tokens/messages every day. Our mission is to make AI accessible to everyone, any developer not just AI/ML experts. We are the only composable AI infrastructure. That's all we do.

- Start by building AI agents Pipes
- Then create managed semantic memory (RAG) so your AI can talk to your data

## Products

### âŒ˜ AI Pipes (Agents)
Your custom-built AI agent available as an API. Work with any language or framework. Highly scalable, dynamic, and inexpensive. You can deploy in seconds. A new LLM computing primitive called Pipe. Pipe is the fastest way to ship your AI features in production. It's like having a composable GPT anywhere.

### âŒ˜ AI Memory (RAG)
Memory is a managed search engine as an API for developers. Our long-term memory solution has the ability to acquire, process, retain, and later retrieve information. It combines vector storage, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and internet access to help you build powerful AI features and products.

### âŒ˜ AI Studio
Langbase studio is your playground to build, collaborate, and deploy AI. It allows you to experiment with your pipes in real-time, with real data, store messages, version your prompts, and truly helps you take your idea from building prototypes to deployed in production with LLMOps on usage, cost, and quality.

A complete AI developers platform.
- Collaborate: Invite all team members to collaborate on the pipe. Build AI together.
- Developers & Stakeholders: All your R&D team, engineering, product, GTM (marketing and sales), literally invlove every stakeholder can collaborate on the same pipe. It's like a powerful version of GitHub x Google Docs for AI. A complete AI developers platform.

## Features

Features
Generate
A Pipe tailored for LLM completions, with all standard Pipe features.

Chat
A Pipe crafted for chat-like completions. Ideal for building chat-bots, ChatGPT, and similar apps.

Prompt
A prompt sets the context for the LLM and the user, shaping the conversation and responses.

Variables
Add variables to a prompts in Pipes to make them dynamic.

Few-shot
Few-shot messages enable LLMs to learn from simple system and AI prompt examples.

Safety
Define a safety prompt for any LLM.

Logs
Detailed logs of each Pipe request with information like LLM request cost etc.

Stream
Stream LLM responses for all supported models on both the API and Langbase dashboard inside a Pipe.

Moderation
Set custom moderation settings for OpenAI models in a Pipe.

JSON mode
JSON mode of Pipe instructs the LLM to give output in JSON.

Store messages
Store user prompts and LLM completions in a Pipe to review in Usage.

Versions
Versions in Pipe lets you see how its config has changed over time.

Experiments
Experiments test latest Pipe config with the last five "generate" requests to see its impact on LLM responses.

Readme
Add a README to a Pipe to provide additional information.

Pipe API
Pipe offers two APIs, i.e., Generate and Chat, to interact with LLMs and integrate them into an applications.

Keysets
Add all LLM API keys once to seamless switch between models in a Pipe.

Usage
View insights of each Pipe request.

Fork
Make a copy of any Pipe either in your account or within any of your organizations.

Examples
Multiple ready to use examples to quickly setup the Pipe.

Model Presets
Configure response parameters of LLMs in a Pipe using model presets.

Organizations
Foster collaboration among users within a shared workspace via organizations.

Open Pipes
Open Pipes on Langbase allows users to create and share pipes with the public.

Tool calling
Call tools to perform operations like fetching data from an API, etc.

## Solutions and use cases

âŒ˜ Langbase is the composable infrastructure and developer experience to build, collaborate, and deploy any AI apps/features. Our mission is to make AI accessible to everyone, any developer not just AI/ML experts. We are the only composable AI infrastructure. That's all we do.

In software engineering, composition is a powerful concept. It allows for building complex systems from simple, interchangeable parts. Think Legos, Docker containers, React components. Langbase extends this concept to AI infrastructure with our Composable AI stack using Pipes and Memory.
